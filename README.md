Project 1 for Object Oriented Analysis and Design at University of Colorado, Boulder

##Name: Lucas Laughlin

Comments are made about each class giving what it does and doesn't do. I felt that the methods themselves were pretty self explanatory and did not comment them extensively. I assumed similarity for animal behaviors to simplify assignment.  

Compile:
from src folder run:
>javac *./java

Run:
From outside zoo package run:
>java zoo.src.Main

dayatthezoo.out will appear in you current directory
